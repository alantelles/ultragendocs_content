### Specific for Linux
    
UltraGen use a famous FreePascal project for serving its web pages. It's called [BrookFramework](https://github.com/risoflora/brookframework). However Brook uses a dynamic linked library to work. It's called [libsagui](https://github.com/risoflora/libsagui) from the same author [Silvio Cl√©cio](https://github.com/silvioprog). It's a high-perfomance web server which you can use to deploy your application in production. For this, we need first add the path of the library to your OS configuration. The easiest way to do this is adding the path `ULTRAGEN_HOME/unix/libsagui-3.3.2/lib64` to your **$LD_LIBRARY_PATH** environment variable. This will enable applications using the `Brook` server in UltraGen.

Another caveat is that **libsagui** depends on your OS [glibc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_C_Library) version. The version shipped with UltraGen is [3.3.2](https://github.com/risoflora/libsagui/releases/tag/v3.3.2) is expected to work with the **2.31** glibc version. If you need another version, please refer to [libsagui releases pages](https://github.com/risoflora/libsagui/releases) and find one suitable. The place where **libsagui** is hosted doesn't matter. You only must ensure that it's included in the dynamic library paths.

## Docker

Not surprisingly, the most compatible and easy way to run UltraGen is using the UltraGen docker image. You call pull the latest version or another image available on dockerhub. The versions are using CalVer for pre releases.
